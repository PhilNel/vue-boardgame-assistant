  movement: `**Movement in Nemesis:**

Movement is one of the core mechanics in Nemesis. Here's how it works:

‚Ä¢ **Movement Points**: Each character has a Movement value (usually 2-3) that determines how many rooms they can move through per turn.

‚Ä¢ **Room-to-Room**: You move from room to room, not spaces within rooms. Each connected room costs 1 Movement point.

‚Ä¢ **Doors**: Moving through a closed door costs 1 additional Movement point (so 2 total to move through a closed door to an adjacent room).

‚Ä¢ **Crawling**: If you're in a room with a Malfunction token, movement costs +1 additional point.

‚Ä¢ **No Diagonal Movement**: You can only move through connected corridors and rooms as shown on the board.

**Important**: You cannot end your movement in a corridor - you must end in a room!`,

  victory: `**Victory Conditions in Nemesis:**

Nemesis has multiple victory conditions depending on your character's objectives:

**Corporate Objectives:**
‚Ä¢ Each player has 2 Corporate Objective cards
‚Ä¢ You need to complete at least 1 to have a chance at victory
‚Ä¢ Common objectives include: reaching specific rooms, scanning aliens, destroying eggs, etc.

**Survival Requirements:**
‚Ä¢ You must survive until the end of the game
‚Ä¢ This means not dying from wounds, contamination, or alien attacks

**Ship Status:**
‚Ä¢ The ship must reach Earth (or your objective destination)
‚Ä¢ Some objectives require the ship to be destroyed instead

**Winning Priority:**
1. Players who completed Corporate Objectives AND survived
2. If multiple players qualify, compare who completed more objectives
3. If tied, compare contamination levels (lower wins)

Remember: Nemesis is semi-cooperative - you want others to help you survive, but only YOU need to win!`,

  reload: `**Reloading Weapons in Nemesis:**

Weapon reloading follows these rules:

**Automatic Weapons** (like Pulse Rifle):
‚Ä¢ Show ammo tokens on the weapon card
‚Ä¢ After firing, remove 1 ammo token
‚Ä¢ **Reload Action**: Spend 1 Action to restore all ammo tokens

**Single-Shot Weapons** (like Shotgun):
‚Ä¢ No ammo tokens - each shot requires a reload
‚Ä¢ After firing, the weapon is "empty"
‚Ä¢ **Reload Action**: Spend 1 Action to reload (flip card back to ready)

**Malfunction Effects:**
‚Ä¢ If you roll a Malfunction while shooting, the weapon jams
‚Ä¢ Place a Malfunction token on the weapon
‚Ä¢ You must spend 1 Action to remove the Malfunction before the weapon can be used again

**Action Economy Tip**: Try to reload during safe moments, not when aliens are in your room!`,

  contamination: `**Contamination in Nemesis:**

Contamination represents alien infection and is a major threat:

**Gaining Contamination:**
‚Ä¢ Being in the same room as certain aliens
‚Ä¢ Failing some Event cards
‚Ä¢ Some room effects
‚Ä¢ Alien attacks (depending on the alien type)

**Contamination Cards:**
‚Ä¢ When you gain contamination, draw a Contamination card
‚Ä¢ Keep it secret from other players
‚Ä¢ Some are immediate effects, others trigger later

**Contamination Bag:**
‚Ä¢ Contains both Contamination cards and Infection cards
‚Ä¢ As the game progresses, more dangerous Infection cards are added
‚Ä¢ This makes contamination increasingly deadly

**Death by Contamination:**
‚Ä¢ If you draw an Infection card, you may die instantly
‚Ä¢ The more contaminated you are, the higher the risk

**Managing Contamination:**
‚Ä¢ Some items and actions can remove contamination
‚Ä¢ The Medic character has special contamination abilities
‚Ä¢ Prevention is better than cure - avoid contaminated areas when possible!`,
